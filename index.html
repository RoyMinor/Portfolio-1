        <p>Hi, I'm Roy &#128075;</p>
        <p>A creative, fun loving, and calm developer who believes great code should be as enjoyable to build as it is to use.
          I enjoy crafting digital experiences, I love soaking up time with family, friends, or my own thoughts (yes, I'm great company too &#128526;).
          Thanks for stopping by and I hope my work brings a smile to your face!</p>

          <h3>Loading...100% Awesome &#128123</h3>
          <p>Fresh off a rigorous boot camp and armed with an accredited Software Development certificate,
             I bring a year of active coding experience constantly trying to improve my skills set,
             paired with a passion for creativity and thinking outside the box. I thrive on transforming ideas into clean,
            functional code whether it’s building intuitive engaging user experiences or sipping from my coffee pot with a straw trying solving backend puzzles. 
          </p>

          <p>My Toolkit:
           Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Sass, JavaScript, TypeScript, UI Design
           Backend: Python, SQL, MySQL, MongoDB, API Development
           DevOps & Tools: AWS, GitHub, JSON, Agile Development, Debugging.
          </p>

          <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll probably catch me deep in documentation or tinkering with new tools to sharpen my skills.
             As a boot camp grad with a year of experience, I’ve embraced the “forever learning” dance of software development—where
             every bug is a lesson and every project levels me up. (And yes, I do occasionally step away from the screen… because I need a brain break or to brainstorm my next idea.)
          </p>

          <p>Let’s connect and build something wonderful—with great code and maybe a few laughs along the way!</p>
